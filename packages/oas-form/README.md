# @readme/oas-form

A simple [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) component capable of building HTML forms out of an [OpenAPI definition](https://www.openapis.org/) and using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) semantics by default. This library is a diverged fork of [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) but is targeted more towards ReadMe's needs with its [API Explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@readme/api-explorer).
